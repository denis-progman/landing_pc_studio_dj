        We are starting the absolutely unique EDM project to help musicians from all the world to promote the tracks, to communicate between each other and to find their listeners.
        Our mission is getting rid of all borders between authors of different levels. We are going to make an environment where professionals and even popular EDM musicians can comfortable and interesting connect with not so popular guys and beginners. Along with it the beginners and developing musicians will have opportunities to have an opinion from experienced and famous men.
        <br/><br/>
        We started our movement more even 10 years ago, we already have a private EDM community with about 100 musicians and djs. So weâ€™ve got some experience how to do such a thing.
        And now our founder became a prof. programmer, got a little iT team, so we can make the project bigger and better.
        <br><br/>
        The first pilot of the project will be introduced in October 2023. The vip access will be given to guys from our private group and for men who has made an application here.
        So this is your chance to get earlier vip access and extra points as well. You need just send as this short form.
        <br/>
        Stay with as look up the latest news. And se you soon in the EDM lable of the future!
